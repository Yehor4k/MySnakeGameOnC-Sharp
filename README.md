# MySnakeGameOnC-Sharp
This is my authentic Snake game written from scratch with C#

If you plan to use it just change path for "record.txt" file

I might implement the main menu with settings in the future

The movement implemented with WSAD keys. You also need to start the game by going in any direction.

Here is the screenshot from the game:
